# Bundle Discount Implementation

## Overview
To encourage larger purchases and increase average transaction value, we're implementing a 10% discount for users who buy 10 or more digits in a single transaction.

## Bundle Mechanics

### Discount Structure
- **Threshold**: 10+ digits in cart
- **Discount**: 10% off total purchase price
- **Application**: Automatic when threshold is reached
- **Compatibility**: Works with standard and special digits, including Premium Pi numbers
- **Stackability**: Not stackable with other promotional discounts

### Implementation Details
1. **Shopping Cart Feature**:
   - "Add to Cart" button appears next to "Buy Now" on digit details
   - Persistent cart count in header shows current total
   - Cart page shows all selected digits with mini-preview
   - Real-time calculation of discount as digits are added/removed

2. **Bulk Processing**:
   - Batch minting of NFTs for improved gas efficiency
   - Single payment transaction for the entire bundle
   - Progressive status updates during minting process

3. **Bundle Suggestions**:
   - "Complete your bundle" suggestions when cart has 5-9 digits
   - "Popular combinations" feature suggesting thematic collections:
     * Birth year digits (e.g., all digits of 1987)
     * Sequential runs (e.g., positions 100-110)
     * Pattern matches (all 7's in first 1000 digits)

4. **Database Enhancements**:
   - `bundle_id` (string, nullable): Groups purchases from same transaction
   - `bundle_position` (int, nullable): Position within bundle for sequential display

### Revenue Impact Projection
- Assuming 15% of purchases occur via bundles
- Average bundle size of 12 digits
- 150,000 digits sold in bundles = $150,000 gross / $135,000 net (after discount)
- **Net impact**: $15,000 discount cost, but with:
  - Higher conversion rate
  - Faster inventory depletion
  - Reduced average customer acquisition cost
  - Increased engagement with owned digits

### Marketing Approach
- Prominent "Save 10%" messaging for bundle purchases
- Gamification of "bundle building" with progress bar
- Limited-time "bundle boosters" (e.g., "15% off bundles this weekend")
- Holiday-themed bundle suggestions (Pi Day specials)
